# Project-specific preparation, run by every `make` target and by
# demo/record.sh before the recipe.
# EDIT THIS FILE for a new portfolio piece — but only these few lines: the
# venv/uv/ensurepip ladder is generic and lives in lib/python-venv.sh.
#
# It must be safe to run repeatedly and must leave the repo ready to record.
#
#   ./demo/setup.sh            prepare, and delete nothing a run produced
#   ./demo/setup.sh --fresh    also remove filed/, for the recording only
#
# Every `make` target that needs a venv depends on `setup`, so plain setup.sh
# runs before `make run`, `make plan`, `make test` and `make fixtures`. It must
# therefore leave filed/ alone: this tool's whole argument is that it does not
# touch the client's files without saying so, and a setup step that quietly
# deletes the filing cabinet before the tests run would be the same bug in the
# wrapper. Only record.sh passes --fresh.
